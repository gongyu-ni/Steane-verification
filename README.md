# Steane-verification

The detailed recovery operation from X and Z stabilizer measurements can be seen from the thesis. Please contact me for the thesis copy. Many thanks.
In general, there are 4 groups containing 8 states in total. All our recovery operations are to convert the negative terms into the positive ones and recovery the other 3 groups into the correct group for the Steane code.
